# Sales_Data_Analysis

This is an analysis of fictional car/machinery sales for a fictional company.

The company has collected a lot of data from 3 years of sales and would like some quesitons answered. 
1) They run various different "deal sizes" and would like to see which deal size results in more sales.
2) They want to see which products bring in the most revenue.
3) They want to see which year had the best sales.
4) They want to see which month out of the year brings in the most revenue.
5) They want to see who their best customers are (bring in the most revenue).
6) They'd like to see who their most loyal/longest customers are.
7) They'd like to see how long it has been since their customers have made an order.
8) They'd like to see if any particular products sell together frequently.

After an analysis in SQL was performed. I have come up with the following conclusions/insights.
1) Classic Cars and Vintage Cars bring in the most revenue.
2) 2004 had the most revenue.
3) The business only operated the first 5 months of the year in 2005 (resulting in very low revenue for the year compared to other years).
4) The "Medium" deal size brings in the most revenue.
5) November is the month that brings in the most revenue every year consistently.
6) The products bringing in this revenue are Classic and Vintage Cars.
7) Euro Shopping Channel (259 total orders) and Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd.(180 total orders) are their best customers.
8) Product codes S18_1342 and S18_1367 sometimes sell together.

I recommend that the company uses the results from the RFM analysis performed on best customers to win back some repeat business. 
There are some customers who have made consistent orders but haven't ordered in a while. It might be best for the company to reach
out to them and see if their needs were met last time. The company also might want to look into their continued expansion into Classic 
and Vintage cars since those 2 products consistently bring in the most revenue. Offering Medium deal sizes more often also might lead
to an increase in revenue.
